Voices are named according to the following scheme: `<language>-<name>-<quality>`
The `<name>` portion comes from the dataset used to train the voice or the speaker's name if it was provided.

A voice's quality comes in 4 different levels:

- `x-low` - 16Khz, smallest/fastest
- `low` - 16Khz, fast
- `medium` - 22.05Khz, slower but better sounding
- `high` - 22.05Khz, slowest but best sounding

On a Raspberry Pi 4, up to the `medium` models will run with usable speed. If audio quality is not a priority, prefer the `low` or `x-low` voices as they will be noticeably faster than `medium`.

### Option: `speaker`

Speaker number to use if the voice supports multiple speakers, such as [`en-us-libritts-high`](https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples/#en-us-libritts-high).

By default, the first speaker (speaker 0) will be used.

### Option: `length_scale`

Speeds up or slows down the voice. A value of 1.0 means to use the voice's default speaking rate, with < 1.0 being faster and > 1.0 being slower.

### Option: `noise_scale`

Controls the variability of audio by adding noise during audio generation. The effect highly depends on the voice itself, but in general a value of 0 removes variability and values above 1 will start to degrade audio.

### Option: `noise_w`

Controls the variability of speaking cadence (phoneme widths). The effect highly depends on the voice itself, but in general a value of 0 removes variability and values above 1 produce extreme stutters and pauses.
